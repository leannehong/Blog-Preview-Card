## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Learn and improving my HTML and CSS skills.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on Flexbox and CSS grid. I'm not the best at it but with time and improvement, I can grow. I'm probably going to try to recreate something simliar to this because I want to practice the concepts that I learn from this.
